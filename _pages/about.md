I'm Sander Moonemans, A DevOps engineer that likes to make peoples life easier!

I truly believe that sharing is caring, so I set up this blog to share my hobby projects and give my audience a step-by-step approach on how to create those projects at home.
My goal is to create easy-to-read blogposts that take apart complex topics in IT and make them understandable.

Besides projects, I also like to talk about other things in IT that are interesting like:
- Automation practices like GitOps, DevOps and MLOps
- Relevant AI topic
- and probably a whole lot more

I will also be starting a Msc. in Data science & Artificial Intelligence in September, so I'll probably share a lot about topics I learn about as well!

I hope I can transfer my excitement about IT to other people with this, so stay tuned!

If you have any questions or recommendations, feel free to reach out to me on my [email](sander.moonemans@gmail.com)

Best wishes,

Sander
